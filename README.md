# Customer-Churn-at-GrayBar
# Customer Churn Analysis Project

## Overview
This project is focused on identifying customers who are leaving or stopping services with GrayBar, a company specializing in American wholesale electrical, communications and data networking products distribution business which also supplies related supply-chain management and logistics services. Through the use of Jupyter Notebook and various data mining techniques, we aim to analyze the different components of the data provided by GrayBar. The project utilizes codes and .csv files to perform data analysis and generate visualizations, providing insights to understand the scenario accurately. The ultimate goal is to develop strategies that can help improve GrayBar's performance and reduce customer churn.

## Data Sources
- The project utilizes data provided by GrayBar, containing information about customer interactions, service usage, and churn status.
- Additional external datasets may be incorporated for supplemental analysis, as deemed necessary.

## Tools and Technologies Used
- Jupyter Notebook: Used for data exploration, analysis, and visualization.
- Python Programming Language: Primary language for data manipulation and implementation of data mining techniques.
- Pandas, NumPy, and other Python libraries: Utilized for data processing and analysis.
- Matplotlib, Seaborn: Employed for data visualization to gain insights.
- CSV Files: Data files provided by GrayBar for analysis.

## Project Workflow
1. **Data Acquisition**: Obtain datasets from GrayBar and preprocess them for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform initial exploration of data to understand its structure and characteristics.
3. **Data Mining Techniques**: Apply various data mining techniques such as clustering, classification, and association rule mining to uncover patterns and insights.
4. **Visualization**: Generate visualizations to represent findings and insights in a clear and concise manner.
5. **Strategy Development**: Based on analysis results, formulate strategies to reduce customer churn and improve company performance.
6. **Implementation and Evaluation**: Implement proposed strategies and evaluate their effectiveness over time.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
2. Run the Jupyter Notebooks `.ipynb` to execute the data analysis and visualization scripts.
3. Explore the visualizations and analysis results to gain insights into customer churn and formulate strategies accordingly.
